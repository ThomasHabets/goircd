     goircd -- minimalistic simple Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server
     ==============================================================

SYNOPSIS

goircd is very simple IRC server, written on Go.

DESCRIPTION

goircd is very simple IRC server, written on Go.
It is heavily inspired by miniircd daemon written on Python.
It does not aim to replace full featured mass scalable IRC networks:

* It can not connect to other servers. Just standalone installation
* It has few basic IRC commands
* There is no support for channel operators, modes, votes, invites
  and so on
* No ident lookups, reverse DNS queries

But it has some convincing features:

* Only standard Go libraries, no external requirements
* Single executable binary
* No configuration file, just few command line arguments
* IPv6 out-of-box support
* Optional channel logging to plain text files
* Optional permanent channel's state saving in plain text files
  (so you can reload daemon and all channels topics and keys won't
  disappear)

Some remarks and recommendations related to it's simplicity:

* Use either nohup or similar tools to daemonize it
* Use either crywrap or similar tools for TLS-capable connections
* Just plain logging on stderr, without syslog support

SUPPORTED IRC COMMANDS

* NICK/USER during registration workflow
* PING/PONGs
* NOTICE/PRIVMSG
* MOTD, LUSERS, WHO, WHOIS, QUIT
* LIST, JOIN, TOPIC, +k/-k channel MODE

USAGE

Just execute goircd daemon. It has following optional arguments:

* -hostname: hostname to show for client's connections
* -bind: address to bind to (:6667 be default)
* -motd: absolute path to MOTD file. It is reread every time MOTD is
         requested
* -logdir: directory where all channels messages will be saved. If
           omitted, then no logs will be kept
* -statedir: directory where all channels states will be saved and
             loaded during startup. If omitted, then states will be
             lost after daemon termination
